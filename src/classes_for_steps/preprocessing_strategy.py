        """
        With this simplified image, we use a border following algorithm [25] to generate a hierarchical tree of contours. 
        Each contour is compressed into four points, storing only corners of each quadrilateral. Any contour which is 
        significantly larger or smaller than the size of a single move-box 
        (again, calculated relative to the total image size) can be ignored. The final contours are sorted based on 
        their positions relative to one another, and each is labeled by game, move, and player. Finally, we apply a 
        perspective correction to restore the original rectangular shape of the move-boxes and crop each of them with 
        a padding on the top and bottom of 15% and 25%, respectively, since written moves overflow the bottom of their 
        box more often and more severely than the top. This process is displayed in Figure 3. We did not pad box sides 
        because chess moves are short, and the players rarely need to cross the side boundaries. This method of 
        pre-processing is nearly agnostic to scoresheet style and will work with any scoresheet style, which includes 
        4-columns and solid grid lines.
